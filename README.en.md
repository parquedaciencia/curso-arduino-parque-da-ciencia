## About the project

This repository contains the code, support materials, and examples used in the teacher training course offered by **Parque da Ciência Newton Freire Maia**, focused on using the **Arduino** platform in experimental Physics activities.

The course aims to bring Basic Education teachers closer to accessible practices in instrumentation, data acquisition, automation, and visualization of physical phenomena, using simple electronic components and C/C++ programming for Arduino.

The material was organized to support the training sessions and to serve as a later reference for lesson planning, workshops, experimental demonstrations, and school projects.

## Goals

- Introduce Arduino as a tool for experimental teaching.
- Connect programming, basic electronics, and Physics concepts.
- Develop practical activities with sensors, actuators, and displays.
- Encourage the construction of low-cost experiments for classroom use.
- Support teachers in creating, adapting, and documenting inquiry-based activities.

---

## Repository structure

The repository is organized into two main versions of the code:

```text
curso-arduino-parque-da-ciencia/
├── ArduinoIDE/          # Code prepared for direct use in the Arduino IDE
├── VSCode/              # Code prepared for VS Code / PlatformIO or similar workflows
├── docs/                # Documentation, auxiliary materials, and LaTeX files
├── tools/               # Utility scripts for images, documentation, and processing
└── README.md
```

The separation between **ArduinoIDE** and **VSCode** allows the same content to be used in different development environments, according to participants' profiles and familiarity.

## How to use

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/parquedaciencia/curso-arduino-parque-da-ciencia.git
cd curso-arduino-parque-da-ciencia
```

### 2. Choose the environment

To use the material with the **Arduino IDE**, open:

```text
ArduinoIDE/
```

To use it with **VS Code** or another development workflow, open:

```text
VSCode/
```

### 3. Open the desired lesson

Each lesson has its own folder, containing the main code and, when necessary, auxiliary documentation, scripts, or data collection files.

### 4. Upload the code to the Arduino

Connect the Arduino board to the computer, select the correct board and port in the development environment, and upload the code.

## Software requirements

To follow the course, the following software is recommended:

| Software | Use in the course | Download |
|---|---|---|
| Arduino IDE | Open, compile, and upload code to the Arduino board | [arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) |
| VS Code | Alternative environment for code editing and project organization | [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) |
| Python 3 | Data collection, processing, and visualization in some lessons | [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) |
| Git | Clone the repository and track project updates | [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |

It may also be necessary to install the driver for the Arduino board being used, especially for compatible boards that use USB-serial converters such as CH340 or CP2102.

Some lessons use additional libraries, such as support for I2C LCD displays. When required, the expected library is indicated in the code header.

---

## Branch organization

This repository uses two main branches:

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | Stable and public version of the material |
| `develop` | Development version for preparing future updates |

The recommended workflow is to develop new lessons, corrections, and improvements in `develop`, and only merge into `main` when the material has been reviewed.

---

## Documentation standard

The course code follows a documentation standard in Portuguese, including:

- institutional header;
- experiment description;
- identification of expected components;
- explanatory comments in the code;
- Doxygen-style function documentation when applicable.

This approach aims to make the material more accessible to teachers, students, and contributors who want to study, adapt, or expand the activities.
